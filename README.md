# Cric8Bazz-IPL
Project Criz8bazz is a IPL data visualizer app

In this project we are going to display the stats of IPL matches played from 2008-2017 in the form charts.
 
 ## This project has three components
1) Front-end
2) Back-end
3) Database

# Technologies used in this project
1) Front-end 
     - (React JS,react-router,reCharts,axios)
     - CSS
     - HTML
     - JavaScript.
2) back-end
     - Python
     - Django
3) Database 
     - MySQL
   
# Architecture
- We use decoupled architecture for this project.
- And this will give us the power to work of front-end and back-end independently.
- At front-end we call api's to get the required data.
- At backend we will create different Api's as perrequirement and write our logic and queries to get the data from database and send the same to client.
