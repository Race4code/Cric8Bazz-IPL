NOTE : GET THE IPL DATASET (https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl)
       The dataset is in csv format so you have to import it in mysql db 
       via any method like using some scripts or directly via GUI of mysql
       workbench.


Here we have all the queries that are  required for this project :

1) For fetching the matches played per year of all the years in IPL
  
  This query will get all distinct season from DB
  -> select distinct(season) as seasons from matches order by seasons asc; 
  
  Now we loop through all season and get total matches played in each season
  -> select count(match_id) from matches where season=2017;
     Note : value season will passed as a variable in loop.
  
  finally we get all matches played in each season.


2) Queries for matches won of all teams over all the years of IPL.
   
     This query will get all distinct season from DB
   -> select distinct(season) from matches order by season asc;

    for each season this query will fetch number of matches won in that season by a team
   -> select count(match_id) from matches where (team1="Sunrisers Hyderabad" or team2="Sunrisers Hyderabad") and winner="Sunrisers Hyderabad" and season=2017;



3) Queries for the year "YYYY" plot the extra runs conceded per team.
   
   This will fetch all distinct teams played in a particular season
   -> select distinct(team1) from matches where season=2008; 

    This will fetch extra runs conceded by a team in a particular year 
   -> select sum(extra_runs) from deliveries where match_id in(select match_id from matches where season=2008 ) and bowling_team="Chennai Super Kings";


4) Queries for the year "YYYY" plot the top economical bowlers.
   
   This will fetch all teams played in a particular season
   -> select distinct(team1) from matches where season=2017;
   
   This will fetch match_id's for a particular season 
   -> select distinct(match_id) from matches where season=2008;
   
   This will all bowlers who bowl in a particular season using the range of match_id that we get from previous call ^
   -> select distinct(bowler) from deliveries where match_id between 1 and 59  ;
   
   This will get total runs spended by a particular bowler in a season
   -> select sum(total_runs) from deliveries where (match_id between 1 and 59) and bowler="TS Mills";

   This will get all match_id's in which a particular bowler has bowl.
   -> select distinct(match_id) from deliveries where (match_id between 1 and 59) and bowler="TS Mills";
   
   This will get total number of overs delivered by a bowler in a match 
   -> select count(distinct(`over`)) from deliveries where match_id=27 and bowler="TS Mills";

5) Queries for the year "YYYY" plot a chart for matches played vs matches won for each team.
   
   This will get all teams played in a particular season
   -> select distinct(team1) from matches where season=2008; 
   
   This will get total number of matches played by a team in a season
   -> select count(match_id) from matches where (team1="Kolkata Knight Riders" or team2="Kolkata Knight Riders") and season=2008;
   
   This will get total number of matches win by a team in a season
   -> select count(match_id) from matches where (team1="Kolkata Knight Riders" or team2="Kolkata Knight Riders") and season=2008 and winner="Kolkata Knight Riders";
